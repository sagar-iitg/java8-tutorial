Java8 Features



##### 

Java provides at least two ways to exit an iteration before reaching the end of a collection—limit() 
and takeWhile(), where the latter was added in the JDK 9.


skip() and dropWhile() functions, the limit() and takeWhile() methods also behave like a door. But instead of initially being shut, these methods behave like a door that is open and then shut forever when the given criteria isn’t met.

The Optional class is useful whenever the result may be absent
